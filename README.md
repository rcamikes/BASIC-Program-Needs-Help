Help Convert BAS to Windows Executable



Hi all, I wrote a BASIC program in 1991 and would like to pay someone to convert it into an executable file for windows.

It have the original BAS files.  I also have successfully run in DOSBOX X as an old executable that doesn’t work with windows. 

I’m interested in getting a full conversion to a windows version or even an HTML. 

I did a little research and it looked like TRUE BASIC could accomplish this BUT I don’t have the time or will to learn a new language, etc. 

So, is anybody interested in this project for a  small fee or just for the challenge. 

Or, point me to a forum or elsewhere, that I might find someone. 

Thx!
